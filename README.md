SPIN ASYMMETRY ANALYSIS DOCUMENTATION 
-------------------------------------

 -  refer to doc_diagram.pdf for a diagram of code
 -  parallelograms = data (3d for multiple files)
 -  rectangles = executable
 -  trapezoid = env vars



Installation
------------
 0. make sure you have the relative luminosity and polarization code directories first;
    (see the next section)
    you need the following root files:
    - counts.root -- scaler counts
    - rtree.root -- relative luminosity tree
    - pol.root -- polarization tree

 1. obtain the code: git clone https://github.com/c-dilks/spin_release.git

 2. my convention: relocate directory of spin code to ~/h5/root12fms/spin, i.e.,
      this README file is ~/h5/root12fms/spin/README.md
    - you can probably run it in any directory you choose, but mind the location 
      of output files, which are expected to be found in ../../Output

 3. execute "install" to create some directories and build source code
    - creates some new empty directories
    - builds source code in src/
    - symlink redset --> ../../redset 
    - symlink counts.root --> ../scalers/counts.root
    - symlink rtree.root --> ../scalers/rtree.root
    - symlink pol.root --> ../polar/pol.root
    - * my polar or scalers directory might be called polar13 and scalers13


Relative Luminosity & Polarization
----------------------------------

 - code and data are found in ../scalers for rellum and in ../polar for polarization
 - rellum root files are rtree.root and counts.root; polarization root file is pol.root
 - spin and "bXing kicked" status are read from ../scalers/counts.root


Data set reduction
------------------

 - This is the process of extracting the TwoTr from Output files to look at
   spin asymmetries for two photon events, which are suspected pion decays
   (see below for some TwoTr documentation)
 - The data set that will be reduced is ../../Output
 - "loop_ReduceData" creates a condor batch file to run "ReduceData.C" on
   all root files in ../../Output
   --> NOTE: FOR RUN 12, THIS SCRIPT IMPLEMENTS A SHIFT FORWARD OF 1 BXING
       YOU MUST LOOK AT OUTPUT OF BxingDistPi0.C TO VERIFY THIS SHIFT IS CORRECT
       FOR THE RUNS BEING CONSIDERED
 - after reduction, run "Diagnostics.C" to look at dependences of kinematics on
   geometry; produces "diag.pdf" with various 2d histograms
 - you can also check for corruption by using GetRedsetEntries.C; if the tree
   in the reduced data set has zero entries, then the Output file tree may have
   been corrupt; see the comments in the header of GetRedsetEntries.C to see
   how to loop this over all files in redset/



Asymmetry Analysis 
------------------
0. Make diagnostic plots `diag.root` by running `Diagnostics.C`; this may take a while

1. Create "env_bins.sh" by running "Bin_Splitter.C" and then source environment variables 
   with "source env_bins.sh"
   - (you should be in a bash shell)
   - you must source this file while in the directory spin
   - most scripts automatically source this file for you, but some of them might not
     - edit the script Bin_Splitter.C to control the binning


2. Build phi distributions using "loop_PhiDists" to run "PhiDists.C" on reduced files
   in redset/ to produce root files in phiset/
   - (alternatively, use "ploop_PhiDists" for a processor loop, i.e., submit jobs
     over all cores without using condor)
   - phi distributions for each run are written to the output file in object arrays, 
     which are named as phi_s[spinbit]_g[eta bin]_p[pt bin]_e[en bin]
     - the histograms in the object arrays have the run number appended to their names
   - `PhiDists3.C` implements an energy-dependent mass cut
     - first, using `diag.root`, run `MassCutter.C` and look at the mass cuts; the 
       cuts will be written out to `mass_cuts`, which is then read by `PhiDists3.C`
   - you need to supply `PhiDists3.C` with exclusion lists, which are lists of runs
     for each jet type (sph,pi0,thr); these runs were excluded AFTER `toa_add.C` was
     executed (see next step) to produce "wdist" pdfs, which are pt and energy distributions
     for each run; a QA was done using these pdfs to highlight pathological runs, and 
     thus if you're running things for the first time, you must run `loop_PhiDists` again
     after the QA


3. Merge the phiset files with "toa_add.C" (this is basically a sorted hadd for obj arrays)
   - this merges all the TObjArrays in the phiset file into "phiset/all.root", where
     the entries of the TObjArrays are sorted by run number

4. Run an asym_call script (see "asym_call scripts" section for further details)
   - asym_call
     - computes asymmetries for all runs considered; check three.png which 
       shows a comparison between single and double spin asymmetries
     - spin.root --> double and single spin asymmetries
       -  en_dep* = energy dependent asymmetry
       -  pt_dep* = pt dependent asymmetry
   - asym_call_out
     - computes asymmetry, filtering out "problem region" (14136002-14139001)
   - asym_call_div
     - computes asymmetry for various run regions, depending on how you've divided it;
       each run region is selected such that the number of pi0s is approximately the same
       - First, run Count_pi0s.C or Count_pi0s_high_pt.C, which counts the number
         of pi0s for whole pt range and pt>8, respectively; the output is a 
         root file called pi0cnt.root or pi0cnt_high.root
       - Then run Read_pi0cnt.C; MAKE SURE TO SPECIFY PROPER ARGUMENTS!
         - div is the number of run regions to consider
         - filename chooses which root file created by previous script
         - the output is "div.dat" which is read by asym_call_div
       - the root files and images are saved to the directory "study_runs" with
         the run numbers listed in the filename
   - asym_call_run
     - computes asymmetry for run regions; the argument you specify is the number
       of runs per region; files output to study_runs/
   - asym_call_fill
     - computes asymmetry for fill regions; the argument you specify is the number
       of fills per region; files output to study_fill/



asym_call scripts
-----------------
 - Compute the double helicity asymmetry, using one of the following methods:

   1. Sum Method (also produces single spin asymmetries A_L blue & yellow)
      "Asym.C" produces "spin.root", which sums all the phi distributions together
      (with their weights) and then computes asymmetry
      - TGraphErrors are kinematic dependence plots
      - numerator is weighted by 1/P, where P = product of beam polarizations

   2. Run Average Method 
      "Asym_run_by_run.C" produces "spin.root", which contains asymmetry calculation results for
      each run; you can then run "DrawAverages.C" to draw average asymmetry over all runs
      for each kinematic bin; a kinematic-dependence plot called "kin_dep" will be drawn:
      - pT dependence drawn if en_bins==1 and eta_bins==1 and pt_bins>1
      - en dependence drawn if pt_bins==1 and eta_bins==1 and en_bins>1
      - "print_all" will draw the four phi distributions + asymmetry for each run and 
        kinematic bin; output pdfs are written to phiset (one pdf per bin, one page per run)


 - Draw asymmetries using "DrawThree.C"

        - Z=1 if N12!=2
